# Canvas
Canvas is a Kotlin-based inventory management system which takes *heavy inspiration* from React.

Those who have used React (especially React-Kotlin) should feel very at home. Those who have not,
it provides reusability and convenience when making complex UIs.

### Early "Alpha"
It is worth noting that performance at the moment is unstable at best. It is still under heavy
development, however the API should not change much so if you are interested in giving it a try,
go ahead.

### Usage
Documentation will be made eventually, however for now there are some samples
[here](src/test/kotlin/com/mattworzala/canvas).
